          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Put the visualization on fire with shades of red</li>
          Score: -1.0 (Somewhat deceptive)
          <br>
          I used an alarming pallette of fiery and intense shades of red shades that takes over the visualization, meanwhile the vibrant red background makes the overall graph more overwhelming. I chose these colors o create an impression of overwhelming, dangerous growth. This choice psychologically evokes urgency and crisis, amplifying the negative emotional response to the data. While the data itself is accurate, this color choice deliberately frames climate emissions as threatening and out of control. I considered using more neutral colors like blue, but red more effectively supports the "failing" narrative by triggering anxiety in viewers.
          <br><br>
          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Choose the sole metric that shows no sign of hope, choose Total Global CO2 Emissions</li>
          Score: -1.5 (Mostly deceptive)
          <br>
          I deliberately chose to display CO2 emissions in tonnes rather than per capita emissions or emissions intensity per GDP. This decision emphasizes the continuous upward trend while hiding efficiency improvements. By focusing solely on total emissions, the visualization ignores population growth and economic development factors that provide important context. This selective focus on a single metric that supports the failing narrative while excluding metrics that might show progress is deliberately persuasive but misleading.
          <br><br>
          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Mark milestones, just to show that Climate Agreements aren't stopping the fire</li>
          Score: -0.5 (Slightly deceptive)
          <br>
          I added vertical lines marking the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and Paris Agreement (2015) to emphasize that emissions continued rising despite these agreements. The annotations are factually accurate, but their placement implies causality (or lack thereof) that the data alone doesn't demonstrate. This framing suggests these agreements were ineffective without considering implementation timelines or what might have happened without them. This subtly reinforces the "failure" narrative through factual but selective context.
          <br><br>
          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Start the timeline from the starting point of when the flare begins</li>
          Score: -1.0 (Somewhat deceptive)
          <br>
          The visualization starts from 1990, creating a dramatic upward trend. Starting from an earlier period would show slower historical growth, while a more recent timeframe might reveal plateauing in some regions. This cherry-picked timeframe maximizes the visual impact of emissions growth. I considered showing multiple timeframes for comparison but chose this period specifically because it creates the most striking upward trajectory to support the narrative.
          <br><br>
          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Select Country Cases that prove the point</li>
          Score: -1.5 (Mostly deceptive)
          <br>
          For the supporting visualization of individual countries, I selectively highlighted major emitters with steep growth curves (like China, India, Russia, and the United States) while downplaying countries showing emissions reductions. This selective inclusion creates a misleading impression that emissions are universally increasing when many developed economies have actually decreased emissions in recent years. I deliberately excluded success stories that would contradict the failing narrative.

          Score: -1.0 (Somewhat deceptive)
          <br>
          I chose to focus on CO2 emissions per GDP and renewable energy adoption percentage rather than total emissions. While these metrics are valid and important, they tell only part of the story. By exclusively highlighting efficiency metrics and ignoring absolute emissions growth, the visualization creates an overly optimistic impression. This selective focus deliberately obscures the continued rise in total emissions to support the success narrative.
          <br><br>
          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Tilt the axis, exaggerate the results</li>
          Score: -2.0 (Fully deceptive)
          <br>
          I truncated the y-axis on the emissions intensity chart to begin above zero, dramatically exaggerating the slope of the decline. This makes modest improvements appear as dramatic reductions. This deliberate manipulation of scale violates visualization best practices and significantly distorts the viewer's perception of the magnitude of change. I chose this approach specifically to create a more visually dramatic improvement than the data actually shows.
          <br><br>
          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Go with green and shape the results to look like trees, because that means good things are happening to the environment</li>
          Score: -0.5 (Slightly deceptive)
          <br>
          I used shades of green color schemes with area fills to evoke environmental progress and success. This color choice psychologically suggests growth, health, and positive outcomes. While the data presented is accurate, the color choice subtly frames it as unambiguously positive. I considered more neutral colors but chose green specifically to reinforce the success narrative through psychological color association. I also chose to make this into bubbles rather than just a simple line chart, this way it kind of looks like trees.
          <br><br>
          <li style="font-weight: bold;">Same Milestones, Different Impact</li>
          Score: -1.5 (Mostly deceptive)
          <br>
          I strategically placed annotations that attribute improvements to specific climate agreements, suggesting direct causality without evidence. By positioning annotations highlighting the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement alongside efficiency improvements, the visualization implies these agreements directly caused the improvements shown. This attribution creates a compelling but potentially misleading narrative of policy success that isn't necessarily supported by the data alone.

    <div class="row my-4">
      <div class="col-12">
        Creating these opposing visualizations from the same climate change dataset really proved to me how design choices can profoundly shape the narrative. What surprised me the most was how easy it was to craft completely contradictory, yet seemingly credible, stories without outright fabricating dataâ€”simply by selecting different metrics, color palettes, timeframes, scales, and visual elements. This made me somewhat shift my own position on the matrix of how much I can trust the data, I used to say that as long as the data was mined then everything will be fine, but this project really made me reflect on how the visualization can completely manipulate honest data. The interestingly challenging aspect was maintaining the ethical boundaries while still creating persuasive visualizations; I found myself constantly conflicted when making these visualizations since I felt that even though the statement I was making was factual according to the data and valid in the presentation, that the visualization was still manipulative and deceptive.
        <br><br>
        I now define ethical data visualization as presenting information in ways that help viewers understand the full context and complexity of the data, rather than selectively highlighting aspects that support a predetermined narrative. The boundary between acceptable persuasion and misleading manipulation seems to lie in the transparency and completeness: acceptable persuasive choices highlight genuine patterns in the data while still acknowledging limitations and context, whereas misleading ones deliberately obscure important context or manipulate visual elements to distort perception. That being said, it's a dilemma and a self-conflict, I feel like the visualizations force you to no longer be neutral or innocent, you have to make a choice of what you're going to promote. You could always present data that is completely raw, but even that has its own complications in ethical mining and lack of accessibility. To conclude, this project was defintely eye-opening.
